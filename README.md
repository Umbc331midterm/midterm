Write an interactive fiction game. It may be as deep or shallow as you like, though obviously greater care in execution will result in a better grade. It should be possible to beat the game given the following instructions:

	GET ALL
	OPEN DOOR
	EAST
	GET EDELWEISS
	UP
	ENTER CAVE
	LIGHT FIRE
	WAIT
	WAIT
	PUT EDELWEISS IN FIRE
	ATTACH HELMET TO STATUE
	SHOW PRISM TO PICKLE
	EXIT CAVE
	NORTH
        PONDER THE MEANING OF LIFE
	SAY XYZZY TO KNIGHT
	EAST
	TAKE DUCK
	EAT IT
	NORTH
	OPEN CAULDRON
	PUT GINGER IN CAULDRON
	SAY PLUGH TO MACBETH
	LIGHT FIRE
	INHALE FUMES
	WAIT
	POLISH MIRROR
	EXAMINE MIRROR

Though other paths to victory are, naturally, preferred. This must be a game with a line-based text parser, not a simple hyperlink game (such as one made with Twine).  The user must type in commands, and the program recognize/interpret/process them.

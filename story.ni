"Midsummer Day"

The Gazebo is a room. "A white canvas parasol raised up on stakes driven into the grass."
The wood-slatted crate is in the Gazebo. The crate is a container.
Mr Jones wears a top hat. The crate contains a croquet mallet.
Before taking the crate: 
    if the player is wearing the hat: 
        now the hat is in the crate; 
        say "As you stoop down, your hat falls into the crate."
